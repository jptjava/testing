Local Working directory files canbe in either tracked or untracked state.

Tracked files are file that were in the last snapshot, thet can be unmodified,modified , or staged.
Untracked files are any files in your wd that were not un your kast snapshot and not in your staging area.

Basically if you create a new file, they will be untracked since they were not in last commit.
Once we add them , they will be in staged state or tracked state.
To remove the file form staged back to untracked 
>git rm --cached filename
